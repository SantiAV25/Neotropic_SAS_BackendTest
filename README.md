![Imagen de la Arquitectura](/arquitecture.png)

The architecture chosen for this API is the Onion Architecture. This decision was made for two main reasons: first, the API's size and complexity did not justify the use of a Hexagonal Architecture; second, the Onion Architecture offers superior options for change and reusability compared to traditional MVC architecture.

## Deployment

The api is deploy in the railway and it could be access in the following link https://neotropicsasbackendtest-production.up.railway.app
